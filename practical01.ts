/*
Create variables named "fullName", "age", "gender", and "phoneNumber" with sample values.
Then display each variable's value in the console using console.log().

Steps:
1. Create four variables to store personal information:
   - fullName: stores a person's full name
   - age: stores a person's age
   - gender: stores a person's gender
   - phoneNumber: stores a person's phone number

2. Display each variable's value in the console using console.log()
   This will print the values to the terminal when the program runs.

let fullName = "Your Full Name";
let age = "0";
let gender = "Male/Female";
let phoneNumber = "9876543210";

console.log(fullName);
console.log(age);
console.log(gender);
console.log(phoneNumber);
