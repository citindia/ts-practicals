# TypeScript Practicals

A comprehensive collection of TypeScript exercises covering fundamental programming concepts, data structures, functions, and advanced features.

## Practical 1

Create variables named "fullName", "age", "gender", and "phoneNumber" with sample values.
Then display each variable's value in the console using console.log().

### Steps:

1. Create four variables to store personal information:
   - fullName: stores a person's full name
   - age: stores a person's age
   - gender: stores a person's gender
   - phoneNumber: stores a person's phone number

2. Display each variable's value in the console using console.log()
   This will print the values to the terminal when the program runs.

## Practical 2

Create variables named "fullName", "age", "gender", and "phoneNumber" with sample values.
Then display each variable's value in the console using template strings with descriptive labels.

### Steps:

1. Create four variables to store personal information:
   - fullName: stores a person's full name
   - age: stores a person's age
   - gender: stores a person's gender
   - phoneNumber: stores a person's phone number

2. Use template strings (backticks ``) to display each variable with a descriptive label
   Template strings allow you to embed variables directly using ${variableName}
   This will print formatted output like "Full Name: John Doe" to the terminal.
