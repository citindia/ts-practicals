/*
Create variables named "fullName", "age", "gender", and "phoneNumber" with sample values.
Then display each variable's value in the console using template strings with descriptive labels.

Steps:
1. Create four variables to store personal information:
   - fullName: stores a person's full name
   - age: stores a person's age
   - gender: stores a person's gender
   - phoneNumber: stores a person's phone number

2. Use template strings (backticks ``) to display each variable with a descriptive label
   Template strings allow you to embed variables directly using ${variableName}
   This will print formatted output like "Full Name: John Doe" to the terminal.
*/

let fullName = "Your Full Name";
let age = "0";
let gender = "Male/Female";
let phoneNumber = "9876543210";

console.log(`Full Name: ${fullName}`);
console.log(`Age: ${age}`);
console.log(`Gender: ${gender}`);
console.log(`Phone Number: ${phoneNumber}`);
